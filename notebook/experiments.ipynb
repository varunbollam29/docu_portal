      "Okay, so the user is asking, \"What is the capital of France?\" Hmm, I need to make sure I get this right. Let me start by recalling what I know about France. France is a country in Western Europe, right? I remember from school that major cities there include Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and maybe Bordeaux? But the capital... I think the capital is Paris. Wait, is there any chance it could be something else? Like, sometimes countries have capitals that aren't the biggest cities. But Paris is a huge city. Let me think. I've heard of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Louvre Museum, the Seine River. All those landmarks are in Paris, which makes me more confident that it's the capital. But just to be sure, maybe I should cross-check. I remember that in some European countries, the capital isn't the largest city; for example, in Sweden, the capital is Stockholm, but the most populous city is Gothenburg. But for France, I don't think there's a similar situation. Paris is definitely the main city. Also, when you talk about the French government, the president's residence is in Paris, the government buildings, the Parliament. Yeah, that all lines up. I don't recall any other city being proposed or previously being the capital. Maybe it's been the capital for a long time. Let me think about historical context. France has a long history, with Paris being a significant city since medieval times. The French Revolution started in Paris, right? So it's been central to French politics and culture for centuries. Therefore, the capital is Paris. I don't think I'm confusing it with another country. For example, Spain's capital is Madrid, Italy's is Rome, Germany's is Berlin. So France's should be Paris. I think I'm pretty confident now. Just to be thorough, maybe I can think of other countries in Europe. Belgium's capital is Brussels, but that's different. No, France's is definitely Paris. Yeah, I think that's the answer.\n",

      "Okay, so the user is asking about GD Goenka school. Let me start by recalling what I know. GD Goenka is a chain of schools in India, part of the Goenka Education Group. They were established by someone named GD Goenka, right? I think he was into various industries, maybe textiles or something else. The schools are probably affiliated with a national board, maybe the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) because that's common in India. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, CBSE is for most private schools, so that's a safe assumption. The schools are probably in major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata. They might offer co-education, covering from pre-primary up to senior secondary. I should check if they have any special programs or focus areas. Some schools emphasize sports, arts, or technology. Do GD Goenka schools have any particular strengths? Maybe their infrastructure, like labs, libraries, or sports facilities?\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the user might be interested in the academic performance of the school. Do they have good results in board exams? Are there any notable alumni? I don't think I know any famous people from there, but maybe they have successful professionals or Olympiad winners. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another point is the admission process. How do they admit students? Is it based on entrance exams, previous academic records, or interviews? Some schools use their own entrance tests. Also, fees and location details might be important. But the user didn't ask for specific locations, so maybe just mention that they have multiple branches across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also mention if they have any international programs or exchange programs. Some schools partner with foreign institutions for exchange programs. Also, extracurricular activities like clubs, competitions, and events are important for a well-rounded education. GD Goenka schools might have robotics clubs, debate teams, or music and dance groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I need to make sure about the correct spelling and any recent changes. Maybe the person is actually referring to Goenka, but the name is GD Goenka. Let me confirm that GD Goenka is the founder's full name. Yes, GD Goenka was the founder. The schools are named after him. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider the possibility that the user is a parent looking for school information, so they might care about safety, teacher qualifications, and the school's reputation. Are there any controversies or notable achievements? I should stick to positive aspects unless I have specific information on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the answer should cover the establishment, affiliation, academic programs, facilities, extracurriculars, admission process, and any unique features. Make sure to keep it concise but informative, and avoid any assumptions beyond the known facts. Double-check if there's any recent updates or changes to the school system that I might not be aware of.\n",
